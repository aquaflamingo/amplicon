# Amplicon

Hosted Biochemistry

## What is Amplicon?
Amplicon is a biochemistry lab hosting application. In the objective of Amplicon is to become a central repository for bio-engineering practitioners and researchers to:

1. Host, version control and collaborate on homegrown laboratory protocols publicly or privately with other contributors
2. Discover new laboratory protocols, tools, and methods which enable them to work on projects they work on

## How does Amplicon work?
Amplicon users create Amplicon protocols which are version controlled. An Amplicon repository represents a particular resource which dictates it's structure and requirements. In other words, a repository has a resource type which opinionates the structure under the hood.
